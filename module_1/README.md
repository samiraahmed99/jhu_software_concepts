# Samira Ahmed's Web Application
### This is my personal portfolio site built with Flask!


## Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. Access this repository in your terminal and navigate from the `jhu_software_concepts` 
directory to the `module_1` directory.
3. Create a virtual environment and install necessary dependencies:   
`python -m venv venv`   
`source venv/bin/activate`  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`  
4. Run the app:   
`python run.py`
5. This should generate an http address that you can copy and paste 
into your web browser and this should display Samira's Web Application.
6. The page you are currently on should be highlighted in the top right corner and by default you should
be on the Home (About) page. 
7. You can navigate each page by hovering and clicking on the desired page located at the
top right corner of the pink navigation bar.
8. There is a footer that includes quick contact info with associated links.
9. When finished, press CTRL+C in terminal so that you can stop the development server.
