        <h1>Samira Ahmed (She/Her)</h1>
        <h3>Master's Student in Data Science at Johns Hopkins University</h3>
        <p>
            Samira Ahmed is currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science through the Johns Hopkins Engineering for Professionals program.
            Her goal is to enhance her practical skill set and apply data-driven solutions to real-world problems, bridging the gap between theory and application.
        </p>
        <p>
            She holds a Bachelor’s degree in Data Theory from the University of California, Los Angeles. During her undergraduate years,
            Samira developed a passion for working with data — especially after competing in UCLA’s two-day hackathon, <strong>DataFest</strong>, where her team received the Judge's Choice Award.
            That experience solidified her interest in applied data science.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then, Samira has focused on gaining hands-on experience with increasingly large and complex datasets.
            Her graduate studies allow her to deepen that foundation and sharpen her ability to solve problems at scale using modern tools and methods.
