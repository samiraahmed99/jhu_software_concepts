# Answer following questions by creating queries

# Something to keep in mind :
# | Field    | Min | Max  | Notes                             |
# | -------- | --- | ---- | --------------------------------- |
# | `gpa`    | 0.0 | 4.33 | Some schools use 4.0, others 4.33 |
# | `gre`    | 260 | 340  | Total GRE score                   |
# | `gre_v`  | 130 | 170  | Verbal score                      |
# | `gre_aw` | 0.0 | 6.0  | In 0.5 increments                 |
