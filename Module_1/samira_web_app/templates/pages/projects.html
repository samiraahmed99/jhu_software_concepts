        <h2>Samira Web Application</h2>
        <p>
            This web application is part of my Module 1 project for Modern Software Concepts in Python class in my graduate
            studies at Johns Hopkins University. This project is built using Flask and demonstrates my understanding of
            full-stack web development, project structuring, templating, and deploying a personal portfolio site.
            The site includes a home (About) page, contact form, and project showcase where I showcase this project.
